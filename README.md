# WinReg v0.5
## C++ Wrappers around Windows Registry Win32 APIs

by Giovanni Dicanio

The Windows Registry C-interface API is  _very low-level_ and _hard_ to use.

I developed some **C++ wrappers** around this low-level Win32 API, to raise the semantic level, using C++ classes like `std::wstring`, `std::vector`, etc. instead of raw C-style buffers and low-level mechanisms. 

For example, the `REG_MULTI_SZ` registry type associated to double-NUL-terminated C-style strings is handled using a much easier higher-level `vector<wstring>`. My C++ code does the _translation_ between high-level C++ STL-based stuff and low-level Win32 C-interface APIs.

The Win32 registry value types are mapped to C++ higher-level types according the following table:

| Win32 Registry Type  | C++ Type                     |
| -------------------- |:----------------------------:| 
| `REG_DWORD`          | `DWORD`                      |
| `REG_SZ`             | `std::wstring`               |
| `REG_EXPAND_SZ`      | `std::wstring`               |
| `REG_MULTI_SZ`       | `std::vector<std::wstring>`  |
| `REG_BINARY`         | `std::vector<BYTE>`          |

**NOTE**: I did a _few_ tests, according to which the code seems to work, but _more_ tests are required. So please consider current library status kind of a _beta_ version! Moreover, code and comments may require some further adjustments. Currently, the code compiles cleanly at `/W4` in both 32-bit and 64-bit builds.

Being very busy right now, I preferred releasing this library on GitHub in current status; constructive feedback, bug reports, etc. are welcome.

I developed this code using **Visual Studio 2015 with Update 3**.

The library's code is split between a `WinReg.hpp` header (containing declarations and some inline implementations), and the `WinReg.cpp` source file with implementation code.

`WinRegTest.cpp` contains some demo/test code for the library: check it out for some sample usage.

The library exposes three main classes:

* `RegKey`: a wrapper around raw Win32 `HKEY` handles
* `RegValue`: a variant-style class representing registry values (currently supported registry types are: `REG_DWORD`, `REG_SZ`, `REG_EXPAND_SZ`, `REG_MULTI_SZ`, `REG_BINARY`)
* `RegException`: exception class to signal error conditions

In addition, there are various functions that wrap raw Win32 registry APIs.

The library stuff lives under the `winreg` namespace.

See the **`WinReg.hpp`** header for more details and **documentation**.
